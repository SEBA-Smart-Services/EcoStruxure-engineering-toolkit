# EBO Application Factory

Mass produce EBO applications, objects or graphics based on a exporetd single template.

This tool allows an exported EBO application or objects to be used as a template for mass producing EBO applications or objects.

Each 'copy' and its bindings (if exported) are updated using a list of placeholders strings in the original template and a list of replacement strings for each copy. The list of placeholders and copies are stored in an Excel spreadsheet.

All 'copies' of the template are written into an xml document for importing into EBO. Each copy is presented in parallel in the root of the import file.
