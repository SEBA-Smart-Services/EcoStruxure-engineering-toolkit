# Make StruxureWare IO bus from points list

# Usage
Create points list, either in Excel or convert to Excel workbook or csv. Close workbook/csv file and run the script from within the same directory. An IO bus xml is created in the same directory, import directly onto the IO bus in StruxureWare.

TODO:
- provide excel points list samples
- provide excel points list schema

# Dependencies
- python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- lxml

This could probably be rewritten to work without any extra python packages, but... I'm busy.
